1. SPI Interface Enablement

The AD/DA board communicated using SPI, which was disabled by default.

Steps:

-sudo raspi-config

-Select Interface Options

-Select SPI

-Enable SPI

-Exit and apply changes

2. System Update and Library Installation

The required packages were installed:

lgpio for GPIO control, spidev for SPI communication,git to download the driver files

Commands:

sudo apt update
sudo apt install python3-lgpio python3-spidev git -y

3. Driver File Download

The official Waveshare repository was cloned to obtain the ADC support files.
Commands:
cd ~
git clone https://github.com/waveshareteam/High-Precision-AD-DA-Board

Now its done , and you can test the codes.

4.DAC Output Test
Procedure: 

-Thonny IDE was opened.
-A new file was saved as dac_direct.py.( the DAC file in the repo)
-The script was executed.

Expected Result:
Red LEDs turned on.(DAC ones; look carefully you will see the led named da1 , da0)
Output voltage was measurable on DA0 or DA1.
Voltage pulsed smoothly between 0 V and the reference voltage.( you can measure with voltmeter)


5. ADC Input Test
 You cannot run this code from the Desktop. It must be saved inside the Waveshare folder because it relies on ADS1256.py being right next to it.So, Download the waveshare example codes itself from its website.

 1. Create the file in the correct location:
Open Terminal and navigate to the folder:
code
Bash
cd ~/High-Precision-AD-DA-Board/RaspberryPI/ADS1256/python3/
2. Open Thonny from this location:
(Or open Thonny normally, click Save As, and navigate to /home/username/High-Precision-AD-DA-Board/RaspberryPI/ADS1256/python3/).
3. Save this code as adc_test.py in that folder.( see ADC files codes in this repo)
4. Run the code  and apply voltage to the DAC, you will see the output on screen in thonny ide. the voltages present already like 1.17 V is normal and wil dissapear once you apply a a voltage to it. remember to use GND, or AGND when necessary.
